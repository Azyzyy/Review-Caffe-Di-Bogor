Kopi Kinca,Nietta,4.0,"I've been there twice for the last two or three months ago with my cousin's. They took me there.
And as the first impression, I like the place. It's quite also comfy. It's a good place for hanging out with your friends.

At that time I was ordered their affogato and gelato.

I love it. It was taste so good..

The price also quite affordable to me."
Kopi Kinca,Ami Savitri,4.0,"Located at GF of BTPN Tower, it provides nice place to enjoy your coffee and snack. The misuguru latte (no coffee) tastes quite unique. The croissant tastes crisp (though for cheese one, well, the cheese amount is very small)"
Kopi Kinca,IRV,4.0,"Roomy, bright, large, spacious.

This is good for big groups.

Coffee: the cappuccino is great, i like the foam. Thick and nice.

They serve this soft bread, cheese üßÄ garlic soft pillow bread that is so delicious.

Good place. Good service."
Kopi Kinca,Abby Marcel,5.0,"The place is comfort for breakfast and lunch. The shop is located strategically at Mega Kuningan business complex. Some of the menu are out of stock, but you have to try their Garlic and cheese toast and Misugaru. It's recommended."
Kopi Kinca,Apoorva Goel,5.0,"Walked in for a quick breakfast. The iced latte and waffles were both outstanding!! Loved the walnut waffle and plain waffle with yoghurt and blueberry topping. Nice healthy twist to the usual maple and chocolate syrups. Must try üëçüèº

Only one request to the management. Please don‚Äôt use single use plastic cups for dine ins!"
Kopi Kinca,Yakobus Rama,5.0,"It's Cozy, Friendly Price, And Awesome, Especially if there is an Event about KPOP Idol/Group"
Kopi Kinca,cretty c,4.0,"Comfy place to have a chill time or for working, but it's quite pricey and the coffee just taste the same with other cheaper coffee shops"
Kopi Kinca,neutral color (mostly green and yellow),4.0,"Nice place, pretty place for photos, great chocolate latte,

but I'm not so sure about the food..
idk if it's because it was a closed event but the tteokboki was undercooked"
Kopi Kinca,Anisa Asha Sarita,5.0,"The place is good, the atmosphere is cozy, the food and drinks are quite good, I think the price is quite expensive, but it's still affordable. The service is great. There's a smoking area outside."
Kopi Kinca,Erwin Nugraha,5.0,Cozy ambience here. I spent almost 6 hours here to work and  to enjoy the coffee and food.
Kopi Kinca,Aminah Hidayati Dwi Putri,4.0,Went there several times for fan events. It's actually pretty spacey but some events just attracted too many visitors so sometimes it was crowded. They have wide choices of beverages. I once tried their rose latte or something. Loved the honey bread and cakes too.
Kopi Kinca,Daniel Hermansyah,5.0,"Nice place for gathering, always love the ambience :)"
Kopi Kinca,Early IH,5.0,"Cozy place, good food to chill and long talk"
Kopi Kinca,Steven Scott,5.0,"I had the Frapeno Green Tea iced drink, hot green tea latte, and original chocolate latte. All were amazing. Equal if not better than anything I've tasted at Starbucks, and slightly cheaper. I also indulged in the cinnamon honey bread. I would compare this to french toast, minus the egg. Was quite delicious. I'd get it again in a heartbeat."
Kopi Kinca,Katherina Kate,3.0,"Bingsu was great. The toppoki's sauce was tasteless only if they don't add generous amount of mozzarella cheese.
The cafe's temperature is so warm, that i can't stand there any longer when my food is done."
Kopi Kinca,Muhammad Azhari,4.0,First time come here waiting for rain to stop. Ordered spaghetti carbonara and chic chips. The spaghetti was quite salty and there is no smoked beef in it. The choc chip just ok.
Kopi Kinca,frinzy zulkarnain,3.0,"The location is strategic. Good for a stop by before or after office. Coffee is ok. Lack of healthier food option. Full of carb-loaded food such as bagel, waffles, sandwiches."
Kopi Kinca,Eva Fahimah,5.0,"It‚Äôs a good place for group or community gathering. Also, I enjoy chatting with friends there. I love the walnut waffle + gelato. You must try it."
Kopi Kinca,Gustav Martono,4.0,"Nicely design, home baked pastry and home roasted coffee

Located in Menara BTPN. They have indoor and outdoor area.

Food is good a bit pricy"
Kopi Kinca,Ias Naibaho (iaszz),4.0,"I love the walnut waffle soooo much!!! One of the best waffle in Jakarta. The gelato is good too, but the variety of the flavor is not so many"

ein.Caffe,Devi Puspitasari,4.0,Tempatnya gak begitu luas tapi nyaman. Pelayanan mbak2nya friendly. Karena cuaca panas jd kita neduh di cafe ini. Cobain nutella croissant nya enak isian nya melimpah. Tp sebenernya makan ginian enaknya pake piring soalnya kalo taro di kantung kertas kayak gini coklat nya pd nempel dikertas syg bgt.

"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Desty Hotifatruwosa (Desty Dee),5.0,"This is a good place to eat with your family or friends, so many spots with cool decorations you can take pictures in here. The price still adorable and taste good too. Of course, halal food provided here.  various bread and cakes, one of the types of food that I recommend.  if you come with some friends, there is a group menu provided.  the bathroom is quite clean, there is a prayer room too even though it is small, the parking space is not too big, but access is available for people with disabilities."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Just Jennz,4.0,"One of the nice restaurant with tropical cafe style concept with high ceiling. The decorations and color combinations are nice. The table is large and quite comfortable to sit longer.  They have 2 floors, have indoor and outdoor seating also VIP room. There are many range of food variation. I tried Indonesian food called Nasi Daun Jeruk, the rice so fragrance and the Sambal Matah is good. The Pink Juice really recommend, made from fresh Dragon Fruits, Strawberry and Orange, not too sweet, you also can request no added sugar too. They also have bakery and cake station. Next time will be back for cake. I bought some bread from the bakery shop and my family member said the bread all taste delicious. The restroom also clean. Staff are friendly, helpful with bright smile. Price wise consider cheap compare to Jakarta."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",SUDAMADJI Joko,4.0,"It is a new place in bogor. The place is really nice and well decorated. They really tought it all to the serving dishes. Everything is well prepared.

We ordered the chips, lontong and thw bbq chicken wings( the whole order costs us 160 k). I personally think than the food could improve, the chicken wings is too sour, and the lontong is also okay only.

And one thing to note is that the love music was too loud. I love live music but it's just too much to handle.

We couldnt even order something without screaming our hearts content.

Nevertheless, of course since this place is still new, they can only grow better, and one more thing, they give us free complimentary cake and nasi kuning, which is nice.

The cake is great as well.

Overall, good job!"
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Fernando Zetrialdi,2.0,"Quite a lot of space with 2 floors.  Price 60k-70k per person.  The menu is quite varied, but the taste of the food still needs to be improved.  Many choices of deserts and cakes for meet up snacks."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Mr. R,3.0,"A rather new place in Bogor, so it's almost always packed especially during dinner time. The design is unique and colorful with tropical vibes - kinda reminds me of the hip cafes in Seminyak. They have many selections of food (mostly desserts and pastries) & beverages. The cheesecake is surprisingly good, but the Tiramisu croissant was so tough on the outside."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Putri Mustika,5.0,"Was working in here from 10 AM to perhaps 3 PM and had a good time. The wifi is really good, along with the drink and food. What i ordered:
1. Korean Strawberry Milk
My fav one! So good, you must try. Milky, fresh, a little bit sour from the strawberry.

2. Japanese Chicken Katsu Curry Rice
Really good as well! The chicken and rice are fresh and still hot when served.

3. Cheesy Potato Chips
Not a fan of this, was expecting fresh potato with thin slices but i think this more like potato chips that has been stored for a while, it still crispy though, but more like snack from a potato bag.

4. Bread Banana Crumble
Love this one a lot! Must try. It fills with banana, choco and cheese."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Yon Cahyadi,4.0,"Quite new restaurant at Bogor...
Serving Indonesian and western food.

Taste 8/10
Hospitality 8/10

In rush hour little bit hard to get parking lot.

There are live music but i preferred acoustic music then full band live."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Historina,4.0,"Many staff around actually but they r not really fast responding to the customer. The place is actually nice, but I dont really feel comfortable somehow. They serve finger food to break fasting but not for every person the staff said. Only 2-3 portion per table. Which in my opinion, better dont serve it if not everyone get it.

The food presentation pretty good but the taste well, so so, not spectacular. To just reserve a table (not a private room) we need to give down payment at least 200,000 IDR, which for me not really comfortable. Maybe because its just opened so its packed with curious customer."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Diany Ismidawosa,4.0,"Food delicious the price is worth it with the foods. Any kind of food in this place bread, western food, indonesian food. Nasi jeruk is favorite menus. The place is instragramable, a lot of place can use for taking a picture."
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Moses Heryanto - TX TRAVEL Bogor,4.0,"Nice modern 2nd floor restaurant with cafe style, locate in Batutulis street, opposite of Sinar Kasih. They have nice sop buntut and ice coffee with mint named 'Dreams come true'. We tried tiramisu cake & coffee late with taste so so. Price is moderate. There is live music on weekend nite"
"La Isola Caffe, Dolce & Kitchen",Bond Tastebuds,5.0,"La Isola turns out to be a cute restaurant in Jalan Batutulis, Bogor with a lot of plants as part of their decoration. Having a meal in here felt like your eating in an indoor garden.

The place seemed spacious in the photos, however it was quite cramped. There was also a bakery selling all sorts of bread.

We had their Mie Tek Tek , Nasi Jeruk and also Potato Chips. The food were great but the Nasi Jeruk took a tad bit too long to prepare. So if you're that hungry, try to order other things as well.

PS. the made great chips with salty and savory flavor. The mayo managed to up the taste a notch.

- Cheers!
